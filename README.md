### **Abstract**

CampusIQ is an adaptive software system designed to intelligently manage and optimize resources in smart campus environments. The system adapts to changing 
campus requirements, resource availability, user needs, and usage patterns through continuous monitoring and feedback. It supports dynamic allocation of 
classrooms, laboratories, equipment, faculty schedules, and other campus resources while identifying conflicts and improving utilization. The system follows 
adaptive software engineering principles, enabling iterative development, continuous improvement, and flexible response to changing requirements. By combining 
automation, data analysis, and adaptive decision-making, CampusIQ reduces resource wastage, improves operational efficiency, and provides a scalable solution 
for managing the evolving needs of modern educational institutions.
